# Chatter Box

A great place to meet new people, reconnect with old friends, or just chat it up with current friends!  Chatter Box only allows current users to access open chat rooms, and allows users to create their own private or public chat room.  

### About 
Chatter Box is a single page application [(SPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) Chat Room built using the AngularJS framework and Firebase database. Angularfire was used to bridge the gap between AngularJS and Firebase, while node package manager (npm) was used to install Grunt which uses Node.js as a runtime environment for running Chatter Box on a local browser via: localhost:3000/ (or another available port).
